# Employee Compensation Analysis

The San Francisco Controller's Office maintains a database of the salary and benefits paid to City employees since fiscal year 2013.
The problem here is to predict the Total Compensation.

# Evaluation metrics

For this particular dataset, we are using r2 score as the evaluation metric.

r2_score (coefficient of determination) regression score function.

Best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the model can be arbitrarily worse).
A constant model that always predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features, would get a score of 0.0.

# Outcomes

In this project, I applied the following concepts:

    Train-test split
    Data Cleaning
    Linear Regression & Regularization Techniques
    r2_score Evaluation Metric
